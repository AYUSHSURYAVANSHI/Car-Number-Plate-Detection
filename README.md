# ðŸš— Car Number Plate Detection Project

## Project Overview

This project leverages the power of computer vision and machine learning to accurately detect and recognize vehicle number plates in real-time. Designed to improve security, automate toll collection, and enhance traffic management, this system provides a scalable and efficient solution for various applications.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Detection**: Captures and processes number plates with minimal latency.
- **High Accuracy**: Employs advanced algorithms to ensure precise recognition of characters on number plates.
- **Scalability**: Suitable for large-scale implementations such as automated traffic systems and security checks.
- **Versatile Applications**: Ideal for use in toll collection, traffic monitoring, and security enforcement.

## Technologies Used

- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV, Tesseract
- **Machine Learning**: Python, TensorFlow/Keras
- **Deployment**: Flask, Docker (optional for containerization)
- **Other Tools**: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib for data handling and visualization

## How It Works

1. **Image Acquisition**: Captures images of vehicles and their number plates.
2. **Preprocessing**: Enhances image quality and isolates the number plate region.
3. **Character Recognition**: Extracts and interprets the characters on the number plate using OCR.
4. **Output**: Displays the detected number plate and stores the data for further use.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    https://github.com/AYUSHSURYAVANSHI/Car-Number-Plate-Detection.git
    ```
2. **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Run the Application**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
4. **Test with Sample Images**
    - Place your test images in the `images` folder and run the application to see the detection results.

## Future Work

- **Improving Detection in Low Light Conditions**: Enhancing the algorithm to work better under various lighting conditions.
- **Integration with Cloud Services**: Exploring the potential of cloud-based storage and processing for large-scale implementations.
- **Support for Multiple Plate Formats**: Extending support for international number plate formats.
